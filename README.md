#Countdown Program

A beginner Python project with two countdown modes:

- **Time Countdown**: Enter a number of seconds and watch the timer count down in real time.
- **Name Countdown**: Enter a name, and each letter appears one-by-one with a dramatic pause â€” building suspense before revealing it fully!

#How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Choose between `time` or `name` countdown.
3. Follow the prompts to begin.

#Features

- Real-time countdown using `time.sleep()`
- Friendly user interaction in the terminal
- Input validation to prevent errors
- Fun and unique user experience

#Why This Project?

Created as my first GitHub Python project to explore input handling, loops, and time functions in a creative way.
